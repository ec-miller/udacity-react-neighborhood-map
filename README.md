# Neighborhood Map React App
### Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program

This app is Project 7 in the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program. In this project we were tasked with creating an SPA in React that displays a map of an interesting neighborhood. The neighborhood I chose is Europe. Using the Google Maps Javascript API, I display a number of locations that I have visited in Europe. The app allows you to click on location markers to display images sourced via the Flickr API. A sidebar allows users to filter the list of locations and select from the filtered list. Enjoy exploring Europe!

### How to Use

1. Save a local copy with `git clone https://github.com/ec-miller/udacity-react-neighborhood-map.git`

2. Install all project dependencies with `npm install` 

3. Start the development server with `npm start`, localhost:3000 will launch in your default browser once it is ready!
